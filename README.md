## Purpose of Jondo Web Scraper

I developed Jondo Web Scraper to automate the process of finding specific but repeated data from every shipping order because the original process would take several hours weekly to complete. Wanting to save the company time, I helped develop such web scraper. Unfortunately, web scrapers are very specific to each and every website, so this project currently is not be able to scrape other websites besides Jondo.com.


## Roadmap

 - [x] Simulate web access via Selenium
 - [x] Launch Firefox Browser clone using GeckoDriver
 - [x] Able to organize information properly into CSV file
 - [x] Basic web scraper from a single file
 - [x] Scraper class for future project expansion
